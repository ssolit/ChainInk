## Description:
The biggest fear in the academic research community, from Newton inventing calculus to 2023, is getting "scooped" by someone else after spending years on a research goal. Introducing Inked and Proof of Discovery. Our novel technology combines the best from Solana Blockchain and Weavechain decentralized private storage. It helps the scientific community worldwide to lock in their idea in a decentralized, secure manner to prove their discovery at a later date. Researchers who "ink" their sensitive research work will maintain the integrity and privacy of their work and share it with select readers using NFT token gating. Later, upon official publication, researchers can easily publish their inked papers to the world, with proof of integrity of their original files. Our solution is uniquely differentiated from the typical IPFS approach to on-chain data storage -- in 20 years, when the latest quantum computers defeat all the "encrypted" data, files secured by Inked through Weavechain will remain secure. In the future, our on-chain academic research infrastructure can be vital for on-chain academic credential proof, professional social networks, decentralized R&D fundraising, and more.
